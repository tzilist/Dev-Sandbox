# Dev Sandbox

Dev sandbox is a website that allows users to put any npm module into it on it's load screen. From there, the modules are loaded on a node.js server, and injected into an HTML sandbox environment. This allows users to test out as many different npm modules as they would like!

Check it out at [devsandbox.co](http://devsandbox.co)
